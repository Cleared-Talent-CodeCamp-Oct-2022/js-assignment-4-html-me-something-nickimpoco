         <h1>Welcome, new challenger!</h1>
         <p>In this simple primer, I am going to introduce you to the fundamentals
            of 2D fighting games so that you can start your own
            journey to become a world warrior.

   <section class="START">
      <h1 id="FIRST"><u>Your first steps</u></h1>
      <p>So, you've watched the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0/">evo moment #37</a> online
         recently, or maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilw0xDkfk2Q">the latest Street Fighter 6
            trailer</a> at The Game Awardsâ„¢ 2022 piqued your interest. <br> Perhaps
         you saw Street Fighter 5 or Guilty Gear Strive for sale on Steam and snagged it, just to find yourself getting
         beat up in ranked matches online.<br>
         <br>Whatever the case may be, let's get you on the path.

            <p>Before we get into the game, I think the best place to start<br>
               with any new undertaking is with yourself.<br>
               It's important to manage your expectations before learning
               something new.<br><br></p>

            <p>Do you want to mess around and have fun playing randomly?<br>
               Do you want to climb the ladder online?<br>
               Do you want to travel and compete in or win tournaments?<br>
               There is no wrong answer to this question.<br><br></p>

               If your goals are not to improve and win, you don't need to master these concepts.<br>
               Investing MORE time and effort rewards MORE fun and satisfaction.<br>
               However, you may have other priorities besides winning at fighting games, and that's okay.<br>

      <h2>People use many different controllers to play fighting games. <br><br>
         Controllers, arcade sticks, hitboxes, mixboxes, bat top sticks, crossup hitboxes, custom controllers,<br><br>
         keyboards, snack boxes, pizza boxes, someone has even <a href="https://youtu.be/n_irhlVNkKM?t=16">made it to
            the main
            stage</a> in a tournament <br><br>
         using a racing wheel with buttons on it. There are many controllers to consider when playing fighting
         games,<br><br>
         and many may argue that certain controllers give you an extra advantage.

         With that out of the way, I want you to forget about what I just said.

      </h3>
      <p id="fantastic">"Real fighting game players use arcade sticks!" is an outdated legacy myth.<br><br>
         Most people saying that grew up playing in arcades, on arcade cabinets, which is what modern sticks you plug in
         to your console are
         modeled after.<br><br>
         Furthermore, arcade sticks were a way to cope with bad controllers in days gone by like the Xbox 360
         controller. What a nightmare that pad was.<br><br>
         Sticks are, admittedly, a very nice novelty item, they are very customizable, and there are a large variety of
         styles and brands.<br><br>
         However, you most certainly don't need one to do good or win.<br><br>
         At the end of the day, use what you enjoy using and what makes you feel comfortable.<br><br>
         Technology has come a long way in making every controller choice a good one.

   <!------- Execution -------->
   <section class="EXECUTION">
      <h1 id="FOURTH"><u>Execution</u></h1>
      <p id="guillotine">Execution here is defined as how well you can execute inputs on your controller or stick,
         <br>not so much death by guillotine (unless you're a Mortal Kombat player...)
         <br>Being able to manipulate your character exactly how you want, especially reflexively is not an easy thing
         to do.
         <br>If you need to think about every individual word you are saying in a speech or conversation, you're already behind.
         <br>Much like learning motor skills as a newborn, this is not learned overnight.

      <h2>Inputting commands</h2>
      <div class="exec-row">
         <div class="exec-col"> 
            <p id="starter">I heavily recommend all new players sticking to one character<br><br> 
               and getting familiar with all their basic and special attacks.<br><br>
               If you spend too many days or even weeks trying to think about<br><br>
               what you are doing while you are doing it, you will suffer.<br><br>        
               And that goes for anything, not just fighting games.<br><br>
               ...<br><br>
               I do recommend most people try and start off with the main character<br><br>
               or protagonist to learn how the game fundamentally works.<br><br>
               However, I also have come to learn while teaching over the years that the key<br><br>
               Is playing the character you like the most, even when starting off.<br><br>
               If you enjoy what you're doing, you'll want to come back<br><br>
               and do it again, because you're having fun, not doing chores.<br><br>
               Your mileage may vary!
