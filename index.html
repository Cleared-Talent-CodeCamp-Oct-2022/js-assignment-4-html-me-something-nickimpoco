         <p>So, you've watched the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0/">evo moment #37</a> online recently,
         or maybe you were finally able to pick up a PS5 at its actual price and bought a fighting game. <br> Perhaps you saw Street Fighter 5 or Guilty Gear Strive for sale on Steam and snagged it, just to find yourself getting beat up in ranked matches online.

               Do you want to climb the ladder online?<br>
               Do you want to travel and win tournaments?<br>
               Your answer to this question will determine how much time you should put into it. There is also no wrong answer, only expectations that don't match your time and effort invested.<br><br></p>
